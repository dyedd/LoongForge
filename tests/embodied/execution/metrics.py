"""Training output -> structured metrics.

Two sources (the execution layer prefers JSONL, falling back to the stdout log when missing):

1. <OUTPUT_DIR>/metrics.jsonl (flushed by the embodied trainer, the most reliable):
   {"step_time": 15.098, "step": 1, "action_loss": 0.4337, "lr": 5e-08,
    "samples_per_sec": 0.53, "grad_norm": 4.1888, ...}

2. stdout training log (aligned with the Megatron format, loongforge/training/train_logging.py):
   iteration        1/      20 | consumed samples: 8 | elapsed time per iteration (ms): 15098.4 |
   throughput (samples/sec/per_device): 0.530 | learning rate: 5.000000E-08 |
   global batch size: 64 | action loss: 4.337645E-01 | loss scale: 1.0 | grad norm: 4.188855 | ...

   Note: loss keys are printed with spaces in the log (key.replace("_", " ")), and are restored to the underscore form after parsing.

Unified output record format (aligned with the baseline JSON):
   {"iteration": 1, "elapsed_time_ms": 15098.4, "throughput": 0.53,
    "learning_rate": 5e-08, "action_loss": 0.4337, "grad_norm": 4.1888}
