# Quick Start: GR00T N1.7 Training

This guide walks you through launching a **GR00T N1.7** SFT training job in the LoongForge framework.

## 0. Resource Preparation

### 0.1 Model Weights

The GR00T-N1.7 main weights are specified by `CHECKPOINT_PATH` and loaded via `--pretrained-checkpoint`. The default path in the script is `/workspace/huggingface.co/GR00T-N1.7-3B`:

```bash
hf download nvidia/GR00T-N1.7-3B --local-dir /workspace/huggingface.co/GR00T-N1.7-3B
```

If the HuggingFace repository requires authentication, log in first:

```bash
huggingface-cli login
```

### 0.2 Qwen3-VL / Cosmos Backbone

GR00T-N1.7 uses Cosmos-Reason2-2B as its backbone. The script points to a local backbone via `COSMOS_LOCAL_PATH` and defaults `TOKENIZER_PATH` to the same location:

```bash
hf download nvidia/Cosmos-Reason2-2B --local-dir /workspace/huggingface.co/nvidia/Cosmos-Reason2-2B
```

Note: `COSMOS_LOCAL_PATH` is **not** the GR00T-N1.7 main weight path. It is responsible for loading the Qwen3-VL backbone, processor/tokenizer, and related config files locally.

### 0.3 Dataset

The script uses the officially preprocessed LeRobot v2.1 sample dataset `cube_to_bowl_5` by default. To train with custom data, follow [NVIDIA Isaac-GR00T](https://github.com/NVIDIA/Isaac-GR00T) to complete offline data preprocessing and convert raw data into LeRobot v2.1 format before training.

```bash
export DATA_PATH=/workspace/cube_to_bowl_5
```

The dataset arguments used by the training entrypoint are:

```bash
--dataset-format lerobot_datasets
--dataset-strategy groot_n1_7
--lerobotdataset-version v2.1
--video-backend torchcodec
```

The data directory must contain LeRobot metadata and video/image fields. If `meta/modality.json`, `meta/stats.json`, and `meta/relative_stats.json` exist in the directory, the N1.7 data strategy will read them automatically at training time to parse modality information and normalization statistics.

## 1. Data Configuration

The following steps are performed online during training:

- LeRobot episode/step sampling;
- GR00T-N1.7 sample transform;
- Qwen3-VL text and image batch collation;
- state/action normalization, padding, and action mask construction.

The default data configuration is:

```yaml
data:
  embodiment_tag: libero_sim
  groot_preprocess_mode: sharded
  max_token_len: null
  preprocess_action_horizon: null
  state_dropout_prob: 0.2
  exclude_state: false
  use_mean_std: false
  use_percentiles: true
  clip_outliers: true
  apply_sincos_state_encoding: false
  use_relative_action: true
  image_crop_size: [230, 230]
  image_target_size: [256, 256]
  random_rotation_angle: 0
  formalize_language: true
  shard_size: 1024
  episode_sampling_rate: 0.1
  num_shards_per_epoch: 100000
```

If you are training a custom embodiment, override the tag at the end of the launch command:

```bash
bash examples/groot_n1_7/finetune_groot_n1_7_ddp.sh data.embodiment_tag=new_embodiment
```

## 2. Launch Training

First, set the paths consistently:

```bash
cd /workspace/LoongForge

export LOONGFORGE_PATH=/workspace/LoongForge/
export CHECKPOINT_PATH=/workspace/huggingface.co/GR00T-N1.7-3B
export COSMOS_LOCAL_PATH=/workspace/huggingface.co/nvidia/Cosmos-Reason2-2B/
export TOKENIZER_PATH=$COSMOS_LOCAL_PATH
export DATA_PATH=/workspace/cube_to_bowl_5
export OUTPUT_DIR=/workspace/outputs/groot_n1_7
export TENSORBOARD_PATH=/workspace/tensorboard-log/groot_n1_7
```

### 2.1 Verify the Training Pipeline

Start with a minimal configuration to validate data loading, weight loading, DDP communication, and the forward/backward pipeline. This mode disables all performance optimizations and uses the standard `AdamW`:

```bash
bash /workspace/LoongForge/examples/groot_n1_7/finetune_groot_n1_7_ddp.sh \
    --optimizer AdamW \
    --cuda-graph-impl none \
    --cuda-graph-pad-length 0 \
    --no-ddp-static-graph \
    --train-iters 10
```

### 2.2 Default Training Configuration

The script enables the following optimizations by default and can be run directly:

```bash
bash /workspace/LoongForge/examples/groot_n1_7/finetune_groot_n1_7_ddp.sh
```

Optimizations enabled by default include:

- **TEFusedAdamW** — a fused optimizer that reduces kernel-launch overhead during the optimizer step;
- **CUDA Graph** — `per_microbatch` mode, which captures a CUDA Graph for each microbatch to reduce host-side scheduling overhead;
- **DDP Static Graph** — enables DDP static graph mode, which is used together with CUDA Graph.

To disable a specific optimization, override the corresponding argument at the end of the command. For example, to fall back to plain AdamW:

```bash
--optimizer AdamW
```

Or to disable CUDA Graph:

```bash
--cuda-graph-impl none
```

Additional notes on CUDA Graph:

- `--cuda-graph-pad-length 0` means the token length is not forced to a fixed value; actual padding follows `max_token_len` from the data configuration or dynamic batch padding;
- To fix the text length and improve graph reuse, set a non-zero `--cuda-graph-pad-length`.

### 2.3 Correctness Verification

To ensure training accuracy is not affected by the optimization techniques, we performed a step-by-step action loss comparison between LoongForge's GR00T-N1.7 implementation and the official one, using identical data, weights, and training configurations. The results show that LoongForge's performance optimizations (TEFusedAdamW, CUDA Graph, DDP static graph, etc.) preserve training accuracy:
