class ChunkPipeGroupBatchSampler:
    """Batch sampler that shuffles chunk groups while preserving intra-group order
    and aligning chunk groups to training step boundaries.

    In chunkpipe SFT, a long sequence is split into multiple consecutive chunks
    that must be yielded in order. Each chunk carries a `chunk_group_size` field
    indicating how many consecutive chunks belong to the same source sequence
    (1 for binpacked short-sequence chunks).

    All chunks of a long sequence must fall within the same training step
    (same gradient-accumulation window), because KV cache is carried between
    chunks and would be invalidated by a gradient update.

    This sampler:
      1. Scans the dataset to identify groups (consecutive chunks with the same group size).
      2. Shuffles groups for training randomness.
      3. Shards groups across data-parallel ranks via LPT multiway partition
         (whole groups, never split), balancing total chunk count per rank so
         that all ranks produce nearly the same number of complete steps.
      4. Schedules groups into fixed-capacity step windows (capacity = num_microbatches
         x micro_batch_size chunks) using FFD (first-fit decreasing) to maximize
         packing density, ensuring no group is split across step boundaries.
      5. Aligns the per-rank step count to the cross-rank minimum, so every rank
         yields the same number of micro-batches per epoch (required for
         collective-sync correctness under DDP).
      6. Yields one micro-batch at a time, keeping group members consecutive.
