"""Pi05 ModelConfig — model-structure parameters (config, from YAML ``model:`` section).

YAML / config relationship
--------------------------
- The YAML file (``configs/models/pi05/pi05.yaml``, ``model:`` section) is the
  user-facing knob: edit it to override any field for a specific run.
- This dataclass provides all defaults and is the single source of truth.
  At startup, OmegaConf merges the YAML ``model:`` section on top of a structured
  default built from this class, then materialises the result into a frozen instance.

Usage rules (must follow)
-------------------------
1. Always read fields via direct attribute access: ``model_cfg.action_dim``.
2. Never use ``getattr(cfg, "x", default)`` or ``cfg.get("x", default)``:
   - a default supplied there creates a second source of truth and hides the real one;
   - a misspelled field should raise ``AttributeError`` immediately, not silently return
     a fallback.
3. To add or change a model-structure parameter, edit only this dataclass
   (one authoritative definition).

Shared fields
-------------
Fields used by both model and data pipeline (``action_dim``, ``action_horizon``, etc.)
are defined here once.  ``Pi05DataConfig`` does not duplicate them; the data side reads
them from the ``model_cfg`` instance passed alongside.
Tokenizer path is supplied via ``training_args.tokenizer_path`` (``--tokenizer-path``)
or the ``TOKENIZER_PATH`` environment variable — not stored in this config.
